# ExamQuickAttendance
Has an online(.php) platform where teachers can post schedules of their exam, a face recognition script for attendance and a script to show who has to attend and who is present.
*This is nothing more than a school project*

## Initalize stuff
-> Need the database with proffesors
-> Gotta login and update some tables

Note: *Tables should use Calibri text for best OCR by Tesseract*
## How to run
```
python face_recog.py
./scriptGreen
```
